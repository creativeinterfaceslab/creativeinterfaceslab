We are a **design** research lab that operates at the intersection of **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)** and various disciplines. Our mission is to design, create, and evaluate interactive tools and experiences that enhance human capabilities and imagination. The primary focus of our research is on User Experience and Interaction Design, with a strong emphasis on **Tangible User Interfaces,**  **XR**, and the **Metaverse**.
While we enthusiastically welcome a diverse array of bold and imaginative approaches, there's a special place in our heart 💞 for designs that echos with **Bharat** (🇮🇳). We're passionate about crafting solutions that understand, reflect, and embrace Bharat’s rich culture, diverse needs, and boundless potential. We openly welcome **Bharat-centric explorations** that intertwine our cultural richness with the cutting-edge of HCI technologies. 🌟🇮🇳🚀
The **Creative Interfaces Lab** is a part of the Department of Human-Centered Design at IIIT Delhi and is also supported by Center for Design and New Media (CDNM) (supported by Tata Consultancy Services, a TCS foundation initiative).
